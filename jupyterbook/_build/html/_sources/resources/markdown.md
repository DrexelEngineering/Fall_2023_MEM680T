# Guide to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed for formatting text. It is often used for writing README files, documentation, blog posts, and even for creating static websites. Markdown allows you to write plain text with simple formatting rules and then convert it to structurally valid HTML or XHTML. It uses a very simple syntax to apply formatting options like headings, bold, italics, lists, and links.

For instance:

- Headings are created using `#`. The number of `#` symbols specifies the heading level (e.g., `##` for a second-level heading).
- Unordered lists are created using `*` or `-` before the list item.
- Links can be created using `[Text](URL)`, where `Text` is the anchor text and `URL` is the link destination.

Here is a quick guide to get you started with Markdown:

1. **Headings**: 
    ```markdown
    # Heading 1
    ## Heading 2
    ### Heading 3
    ```
   
2. **Text Styles**: 
    ```markdown
    **Bold Text**
    *Italic Text*
    ```
   
3. **Links**: 
    ```markdown
    [Visit Google](https://www.google.com)
    ```
   
4. **Lists**: 
    ```markdown
    - Item 1
    - Item 2
    ```
    or
    ```markdown
    1. First Item
    2. Second Item
    ```

5. **Code Blocks**: 
    Use three backticks (```) to create a code block. For syntax highlighting, specify the language right after the first set of backticks.
    ```markdown
    ```python
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world!")
    ```

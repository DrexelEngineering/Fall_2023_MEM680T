<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
<p>The only way to learn coding is to solve problems! It is essential for students to complete all of the homework assignments. The purpose of homeworks will for you to practice the concepts covered in class.  Completing all the homework problems is the best way to practice and prepare for quizzes and exams.</p>
<p>Homework assignments are designed to enhance your skills in independent problem-solving. While discussions with peers are encouraged, the actual coding work must be your own. Homework assignments will lay the foundation for your final project and must be submitted via a shared GitHub repository.</p>
<p>If you need or desire an extension on any homework or lab for any reason, contact Prof. Agar in a timely fashion, as permitted by the need. There is no guarantee that you will receive an extension on any assignment, so plan your schedule carefully. Finally, you are encouraged to work with others on homeworks. Learning is a social activity! However, do not simply use others to do your work but rather use others to help work through and engage in the concepts. If you work with others on written homeworks, indicate on your assignment with whom you worked. \emph{Plagiarism is unacceptable} and will result in a zero grade for all persons involved, and will result in serious academic repercussions.</p>
<p>Homework should be submitted as a professional document, All homework should be submitted digitally.

<h2 id="academic-policies">Academic Policies</h2>
<h3 id="drexel-university-attendance-policy">Drexel University Attendance Policy</h3>
<h3 id="excused-absences-due-to-university-sponsored-activities">Excused Absences due to University Sponsored Activities</h3>
<p>Many students participate in University-sponsored activities in which they represent the University or their academic college or department. Such activities may cause a student to be absent from class. In those instances, such absences qualify as &quot;excused absences&quot; which means that the absence, with proper prior arrangement, is not subject to penalty. Any missed coursework should be satisfied through agreement between the instructor and the student. Some examples of events that may qualify for excused absence include athletic competition, research or a presentation in which the student is an integral member of the presenting team, musical or performing arts events. To determine if an event qualifies as an excused absence, students are encouraged to discuss the activity with their instructor(s) and academic advisor prior to the absence.</p>
<p>Students seeking approval for an approved absence are responsible for notifying their instructor(s) at least two (2) weeks in advance of such absences. If the activity is at the beginning of the term or is the result of a particular level of achievement in an activity (i.e. qualifying for a post season tournament in athletics), students should notify their instructor(s) as soon as possible. Instructors are expected to make reasonable accommodations for these class absences including administration of make-up assignments and exams whenever possible. Please note, however, that the requirements of some courses or programs may preclude such accommodations.
It is expected that students seeking an excused absence will work with their instructor(s) to develop a plan and timetable to make up the missed coursework.</p>
<h3 id="other-absences">Other Absences</h3>
<p>Unforeseen events or circumstances may occur that cause a student to be absent from class. These could include personal or family illness, bereavement, accident, or a catastrophic event such as fire. If such issues arise, students are encouraged to notify their instructors as soon as possible to explain their absence from class. In doing so, students should review the syllabi for their courses with particular attention given to the instructor's statements on course attendance and/or absences. Jointly, the student and instructor will develop a plan, with a timetable, to make up missed coursework. Instructors are expected to make reasonable accommodations for these class absences including administration of make-up assignments and exams whenever possible.</p>
<p>If an instructor is concerned that a student is providing false information regarding the reasons for their absence from class, the matter should be referred to the Dean or Dean’s designee for additional inquiry. Providing false information regarding the reasons for a course absence may be a violation of the Student Code of Conduct and result in disciplinary action, as appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="religious-observances">Religious Observances</h3>
<p>Students should review the Religious Observances Statement in the event they are seeking an <a href="https://drexel.edu/provost/policies-calendars/policies/religious-observances/">excused absence for a religious observance</a></p>
<h3 id="extended-absences">Extended Absences</h3>
<p>In the event of extended absence where several classes have been missed, students should explore options other than those described above, such as requesting an Incomplete grade (please reference the <a href="https://drexel.edu/provost/policies-calendars/policies/incomplete_grades/">Incomplete Grades Policy</a>) or withdrawal (please reference the <a href="https://drexel.edu/provost/policies-calendars/policies/course-withdrawal/">Course Withdrawal Policy</a>). It is strongly recommended that students consult with their academic advisor to determine the best course of action given the circumstances, academic progression, and goals.</p>
<p>In the event of an extended absence due to a chronic medical condition or disability, students are strongly advised to contact (1) the <a href="https://drexel.edu/disability-resources/about/overview/">Office of Disability Resources</a> to explore potential accommodations that may be available and (2) their academic advisor to explore possible academic options. A student's academic advisor can review policies governing such options as withdrawal or incomplete grade and discuss the potential impact of electing these options.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="prof-agars-attendance-policy">Prof. Agar's Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>Prof. Agar will approve absences associated with any physical or mental health requests, family emergency, religious request, or any other reasonable requests. Note that it is not a requirement that you disclose any specific details regarding your reason for requesting absenteeism. The requirement is that you specify, for instance, that the request is health or religion related. You should not feel the need to disclose the nature of your health issue or your religious affiliation. If absence is requested for an extended period of time a letter from a external professional representative (e.g., a doctor, a clergy member) might be requested. This letter should merely state the dates when you will be absence and the categorical reason for your absence (e.g., religious).</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="covid-19">COVID-19</h3>
<p>We are in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. We want to ensure the safety of our community. As a result, if you feel as if you are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, or had a possible exposure please refrain from coming to class. I will make sure to simulcast the lectures online as long as the request is made prior to the start of lecture.</p>
<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>
<p>Be proactive about your success in the course!  If you need help, there are many resources available to help you. Your first primary contact for help is the instructor. If you are struggling, attend office hours or send an email or teams message. Do not wait to bring issues, course related or otherwise, to the attention of the instructor. If you cannot attend office hours, send an email to the instructor to try to make other arrangements.</p>
<h3 id="accommodations-for-learning-differences">Accommodations for Learning Differences</h3>
<p>Prof. Agar welcomes individuals with learning differences and is committed to ensuring equal access so that all students can live, learn, and lead at Drexel.
To <a href="https://drexel.edu/disability-resources/support-accommodations/student-family-resources/">request accommodations</a> a current Accommodations Verification Letter (AVL) in the <a href="http://accommodate.drexel.edu/ClockWork/">ClockWork database</a> is required before accommodations can be made. These requests are received by <a href="https://drexel.edu/disability-resources/">Disability Resources (DR)</a>, who then issues the AVL to the appropriate contacts. For additional information, visit the Disability Resources website, or contact DR for more information by phone at 215.895.1401, or by email at <a href="mailto:disability@drexel.edu">disability@drexel.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Students who are approved for accommodations at Drexel should share this letter and discuss their accommodations and learning needs with instructors as early in the semester as possible.
Prof. Agar will do everything possible to accommodate students needs.
If you feel that your accommodations are not being met please make sure to contact Prof. Agar.</p>
<p>Agar understands that there are inequities in access to testing required to get approved for accommodations. If you feel that you have learning difference that influence equity in your classroom performance please reach out to Prof. Agar. He will work with you to try and accommodate your learning differences.</p>
<h3 id="faithtradition-observance-policies">Faith/Tradition Observance Policies</h3>
<p>Prof. Agar extends hospitality to all persons regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, economic or social background.</p>
<p>Prof. Agar honors the free exercise of religion. People from a wide variety of religious traditions live and work at Drexel, and the demands of religious observance in some traditions may cause conflicts with classroom and work schedules.</p>
<p>Prof. Agar will exempt any person who requests an absence due to the demands of religious holiday observance. Of course, nothing exempts a student from meeting course requirements or completing assignments, so the student will have to negotiate with the instructor any make-up work.</p>
<p>Accommodations are to be dealt with on the basis of individual requests from students. Recall that religious holidays are numerous, and no holiday is privileged above another.</p>
<p>If you encounter a schedule conflict with your course work due to the demands of religious observance, here is what you should do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk  with your instructor and indicate that you will be absent from class due to observance of religious holidays.</li>
<li>Arrange with the instructor to complete assignments.</li>
</ul>
<p>For any further questions please refer to Drexel’s <a href="https://drexel.edu/oed/diversity/religious-accommodations/">Religious Accommodation Policy</a></p>
<h3 id="counseling-services">Counseling Services</h3>
<p>College can be a time of uncertainty, inquiry, expansion, and adaptation for many students. Know that my office and conversations with me are a safe place.
Personal information told to me in private will remain confidential.
The only exception is sexual misconduct or if I feel that you are at risk of harming yourself or others.
If this information is relayed to me I have an obligation to notify the dean of students.

Students initially meet with a therapist for an assessment to discuss their presenting concerns and to determine the type of services which will best meet their needs.</p>
<h4 id="wellness-workshops">WELLNESS WORKSHOPS</h4>
<p>The Counseling Center offers several Emotional Wellbeing Workshops throughout the term that offer information, coping strategies, and tools to address common concerns faced by college students. We know that Drexel students are incredibly busy and can benefit from quick and useful tools for common presenting concerns. Workshops meet once a week for a series of 3-4 weeks for 50 minutes. Our Wellness Workshops are formatted so that you can expect a classroom-style learning environment, and you can share as much or as little as you want. Each workshop comes with a student workbook that allows you to practice new skills between sessions. Click here to see which Workshops are currently being offered.</p>
<p>If you are interested in attending any (or all!) of the workshops, schedule an Initial Consultation and tell your counselor. If you are already seeing a therapist at the Counseling Center, tell them you are interested in a workshop. You are free to do more than one workshop and to repeat them as often as you like!

<h3 id="gender-and-sexual-identity">Gender and Sexual Identity</h3>
<p>People commonly use gender and sexual orientation as part of their identity. A person's identity should not be assumed based on societal norms or constructs as they are not related to a person's self-identity. Unfortunately, English uses gendered pronouns. A culture of pronoun sharing will be cultivated in my classroom. If you do not know someone's pronouns, it is preferred to use identity-agnostic (they/them) pronouns until you hear from them directly. Prof. Agar will not tolerate any bias or discrimination based on a person's likeness or identity.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="email-policy">Email Policy</h3>
<p>Drexel University has established email as a primary vehicle for official communication with students, faculty, and staff.

<h3 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity Policy</h3>
<p>Drexel University expects all members of its community to uphold the highest values of academic integrity. In upholding these values, the University is committed to investigating any allegation of violations of academic integrity against a student. Violations include, but are not limited to: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, and academic misconduct.</p>
<p>Sanctions for violations of academic integrity are administered through the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards in conjunction with the Office of the Provost and other University offices as deemed appropriate. It is generally the responsibility of the faculty member overseeing the academic activity to report the violation to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards and to determine the appropriate sanction. A student who believes they have been wrongly sanctioned has a right to an appeals process.</p>
<p>In addition to any other sanction, the University reserves the right in its sole discretion to withdraw an earned degree even though it has been granted should it be discovered at any time that the work upon which the degree was based, or the academic records in support of such degree, have been falsified. In that situation, the degree will be withdrawn promptly upon discovery of the falsification and the academic record will be updated to reflect the withdrawal of degree.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="student-code-of-conduct">Student Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>Student Conduct &amp; Care seeks to create and maintain a process that is transparent and equitable for Students and Student Organizations. The policies and process described on this website have, in some cases, been paraphrased to provide a general understanding. The <a href="https://drexel.edu/studentlife/~/media/Drexel/Sites/StudentLife/Documents/community-standards/Drexel-University-Code-of-Conduct.ashx">full Code of Conduct (the Code)</a> can be downloaded for review.</p>
<p>Conduct Creed
Student Conduct &amp; Care has established, in accordance with its mission, vision, and values, a code of high standards of behavior to include the following expectations for Students and Student Organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept responsibility when their choices or actions have negatively impacted themselves, others, or the community at large.</li>
<li>Engage in constant learning, practice self-reflection, and develop resilience to maintain academic, personal, and professional integrity.</li>
<li>Foster positive relationships with others.</li>
<li>Ensure the health, wellness, and safety of themselves and their communities.</li>
<li>Demonstrate mutual respect and equity within the bounds of the Code of Conduct.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="defining-drexels-culture-of-inclusion">Defining Drexel's Culture of Inclusion</h3>
<p>At Drexel University, we are committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment based on integrity, trust and respect. We view the diversity of our students, faculty, professional staff and partners as our strength. As such, we strive to create a culture where everyone can leverage their uniqueness to foster innovation because they feel a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>We define diversity as the differences that make us uniquely who we are. This includes both individual (personality, values, attitudes, etc.) and other dimensions of difference including ideological, intellectual, economic, gender, gender identity, ability, sexual orientation, religious, age, racial, cultural, ethnic, visible and invisible disabilities, veteran status, nationality, and all the diversity of our students, faculty, professional staff, alumni, and other partners.</p>
<p>To maximize the strength that our diversity brings, we center equity, inclusion and belonging, and incorporate an anti-racism approach to our strategic plan, organizational systems, policies, and structures.</p>
<h4 id="anti-racism">Anti-racism</h4>
<p>The active process of identifying and ending racism by changing our organizational systems, policies and structures to redistribute power and resources more equitably among all individuals, both at the personal and systemic levels.</p>
<h4 id="belonging">Belonging</h4>
<p>A sense of psychological safety that affords the ability for each member of the Drexel University community to be their authentic self without fear of judgement, where everyone can perform at their best because they feel accepted, respected, valued and heard.</p>
<h4 id="equity">Equity</h4>
<p>The process by which we aim to achieve fairness through reallocation of University resources and opportunities such that policies, structures, and their implementation work to eliminate historical, systemic disadvantage for the benefit of everyone. This requires providing varying levels of support both at the individual and systemic levels.</p>
<h4 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h4>
<p>We adopt <a href="https://www.aacu.org/making-excellence-inclusive">Association of American Colleges and Universities'</a> definition of inclusion as: The active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity—in the curriculum, in the cocurriculum, and in communities (intellectual, social, cultural, geographical) with which individuals might connect—in ways that increase awareness, content knowledge, cognitive sophistication, and empathic understanding of the complex ways individuals interact within systems and institutions.</p>
<h4 id="institutional-racism">Institutional Racism</h4>
<p>Institutional polices, processes and biased practices that favor white people over Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.</p>
<h4 id="racism">Racism</h4>
<p>Racial prejudice based on unfounded beliefs and irrational fear combined with institutional power. This can be at the individual level (conscious and subconscious beliefs and actions that promote racism), the interpersonal level (racist slurs or actions), and systemic level (in institutions).</p>

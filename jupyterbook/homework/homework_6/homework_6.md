# MEM680T - Homework Assignment 6: Machine Learning Application in Project Dataset

## Objective

This assignment focuses on applying machine learning techniques to your project dataset to solve a specific problem. You will extend your initial data visualization, preprocess your data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. The goal is to deepen your understanding of machine learning workflows and to enhance your skills in data handling and model evaluation.

## Assignment Details

1. **Initial Data Visualization:**
   - Extend your previous data visualization homework to include additional insights or dimensions of your dataset.
   - Use visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or any other relevant libraries to showcase the dataset's characteristics.

2. **Data Preprocessing Guide:**
   - Provide a step-by-step guide of the preprocessing steps performed on your dataset. This should include:
     - Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies in the data.
     - Data Normalization: Explain the method used for normalization (e.g., Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization) and apply it to your dataset.

3. **Visualization of Preprocessed Data:**
   - Create visualizations of your dataset post-cleaning and normalization. Highlight the changes and improvements made in the data.

4. **Machine Learning Challenge Description:**
   - Write a detailed description of the machine learning problem you are addressing with your dataset. Discuss why it is challenging, considering factors like data complexity, feature selection, class imbalance, etc.

5. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Train at least one supervised and one unsupervised machine learning model relevant to your project.
     - Include a pipeline for each model that incorporates hyperparameter tuning. Tools like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV can be used for this purpose.
     - Document the process, including the choice of models, hyperparameters considered, and the tuning method.

6. **Model Evaluation Visualization:**
   - Provide visualizations (like confusion matrices, ROC curves, cluster visualizations) to demonstrate the performance of your models.
   - Explain whether the models did a good or bad job at solving the problem, using these visualizations as support.

7. **Improvement Strategies Using ChatGPT:**
   - Use ChatGPT to define three possible strategies for improving the performance of your models. This could involve suggestions on feature engineering, alternative algorithms, or data augmentation techniques.

## Submission Requirements

- A comprehensive report including:
  - All code and visualizations created during the assignment.
  - A detailed description of the preprocessing steps, machine learning challenge, and model training processes.
  - A critical evaluation of the model performances with supporting visualizations.
  - Proposed strategies for model improvement from ChatGPT.
- Submit the report in a functional python package in your git repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Quality and clarity of data visualizations.
- Thoroughness and effectiveness of data preprocessing.
- Depth of understanding in the machine learning challenge description.
- Correct implementation and documentation of the machine learning models and hyperparameter tuning.
- Insightfulness in the evaluation of model performance and proposed improvements.
